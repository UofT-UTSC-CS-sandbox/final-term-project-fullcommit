## Introduction
Hospitals have the duty of saving lives and serving patients by providing the best care possible. It is crucial to equip a powerful management system for hospitals because any management error may cause serious consequences such as delays in patients' treatment or even patient deaths. Therefore, our team aimed to build an ideal management system for hospitals that can be referenced by future developers who will build an actual one.

Our system supports the following functionalities:
* Medicine Registry
* Medical Equipment Availability
* Staff Member Shifts Management
* Inventory Management
* Previous/New workplaces for staff
* Patient Scheduler/Categorizer

## Contribution
* We use Git Flow.
* Pull requests will be used to review potential merges of branches when features are being done.
* The typical naming conventions (i.e feat, bugfix, etc) will be used when naming branches. An example would be "feat/user-authentication".
* Hyphens will be used to separate words when naming branches and '/' will be used to categorize branches heirarchically.
* We use Jira as our ticketing website.
* Each commit message starts with a keyword, followed by a detailed description of the changes made. For example, "chore: prettier".

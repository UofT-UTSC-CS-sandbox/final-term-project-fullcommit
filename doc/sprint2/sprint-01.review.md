 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 5 2024
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction:  

During this iteration, our team focused on developing and integrating key features for the hospital management system, including directories for physicians, and pages for managing bed and equipment availability. We also aimed to refine our database structure and ensure comprehensive documentation of our work.


#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).  

##### Answer:

* **Focused Feature Development**: By dividing the project into specific features (Physician Directory, Bed Availability, Equipment Availability), we were able to concentrate on individual parts and achieve visible progress. This approach also facilitated clear assignment of responsibilities.

* **Frontend Focus**: Allocating more resources to frontend development enabled us to create a cohesive user interface. The use of a common frontend framework minimized redundant coding and streamlined the integration process. This approach resulted in a uniform look and feel across the application.

* **Defined Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly defined roles helped streamline task assignment and accountability. This clarity reduced confusion and ensured that tasks were appropriately distributed according to team members' strengths, especially compared to last sprint.



#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

##### Answer:


 * **Version Control Issues**: There were instances where team members accidentally pushed to the master branch instead of creating separate branches, and there was insufficient discussion on pull requests. This led to version control conflicts and difficulties in tracking changes, highlighting the need for better version control practices.

 *  **Infrequent Database Refinement Sessions**: The team did not allocate enough time for refining the database structure. This resulted in a rushed refinement process towards the end of the iteration, potentially affecting data integrity.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

##### Answer:

 *  **Regular Database Review Sessions**: Schedule regular sessions dedicated to database refinement and review. This can ensure consistent progress and thorough refinement without last-minute rushes.

 * **Improved Version Control Practices**: Implement a strict branching strategy where all team members must create feature branches for their work. Enhance the pull request process by requiring reviews and discussions before merging. This can prevent accidental changes to the master branch, reduce conflicts, and ensure that all changes are reviewed and discussed.




## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

##### Answer:
* **Develop a functional Physician Directory**: Implemented search and filter functionality; displayed physician details in a card format.

* **Create a Bed Availability management page**: Developed a page to display bed availability, with booking and releasing functionality.

* **Create an Equipment Availability management page**: Developed a page to display equipment availability, with booking and releasing functionality.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

##### Answer:

* **Refine our database** : This part is not 100% completed yetneeds further refinement. We still need more time to discuss about the whole data structure. Did not allocate sufficient time and resources. We will schedule dedicated meetings and sessions for database refinement in the next iteration.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

##### Answer:

* **Thorough Task Estimation**:
   - Ensure tasks are estimated with appropriate buffer times to account for unexpected complexities.

* **Regular Database Maintenance**:
   - Schedule regular sessions to refine and review the database to maintain data integrity and structure.
   
* **Prioritize Critical Tasks**:
   - Use a prioritization matrix to focus on high-impact, high-urgency tasks first, ensuring critical goals are met on time.

* **Effective Communication**:
   - Balance written updates with real-time discussions to reduce miscommunication and ensure clarity.

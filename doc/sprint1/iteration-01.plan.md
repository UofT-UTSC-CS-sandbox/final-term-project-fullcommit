# Impaction/FullCommit
 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 1

 * Start date: June 7th, 2024
 * End date: June 16th, 2024

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.
* Feature developers - Xiaoran, Daren
* Administration details - Catherine

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
* Written standups, spaced out, informing progress and blockers
* Voice call meetings twice per week to finalize document submission and demo of features

<i>What's the purpose of each meeting?</i>
The purpose of each meeting is to discuss what was done since the last meeting and to revise any roles and responsibilites as needed.

#### Artifacts

<!-- List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members? -->




## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks
<i>
 Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.</i>

Our core aim is prioritizing a visible demonstration.
* Through out the sprint, work on learning techstack
* Work on our frontend features / JIRA stories.
* Holding standups to meet and discuss work on features.  

User stories:
* As a physician, I want to know how to contact my colleagues so I can talk to them virtually.
* As a physician, I want to know the specialties of other physicians so I can refer my patients to them.
* As a physician, I want to know my patients' last vaccine shots and blood work tests so I can keep them up to date.
* As a physician, I want to know my patients' last appointment so I can recommend another checkup.
* As a physician, I want to write notes about my patients for future reference.
* As a user (physician / patient), I want to be able to view my profile.
* As a physician, I wish to be able to view different types of medicine.
* As a physician, I wish to be able to view a directory of all patients.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

  Our Artifacts:
  * Code for features:
    * Aim to produce frontend features of four main pages (profiles, login screen, user directories, patient scheduling) for demo.
    * Aim to initialize a database. Later on, will connect to the frontend.
    * Aim to setup initial routing so frontend features will be visible.
  * Hardcoding sample data in users (profiles / directories), as well as sample imagery (profiles).
  * Aim to finalize documentations for submission.

    Your mark = 3, Storing/handling healthcare data comes with a boatload of regulations, and privacy compliance issues. Although we don’t expect a fully HIPAA compliant application, there should be some mention of research done into this. Additionally, no research done on where you will be getting medicine registry data (medicine name, pricing, alternatives etc).

    - 0 marks = not at all

    Your mark = 3, There’s already a lot of existing hospital administration software. Compacting a lot of these CRUD features into one hub doesn’t necessarily show creativity. 

I’d recommend finding some more novel ideas, and cutting out some of your more CRUD features. 

For example storage system for appointment transcriptions with attached diagnosis.

Essentially this is a feature where a doctor can record appointments, and upload them to your application, where you can generate a script, and store on your system. The doctor can also attach the resulting diagnosis from the appointment.

Aside from the obvious benefits (time saving, centralization, etc), a massive plus point is that other doctors can search for appointments in your system which had specific diagnosis’ for education, and research purposes.

This could be a great feature to replace your medicine registry.

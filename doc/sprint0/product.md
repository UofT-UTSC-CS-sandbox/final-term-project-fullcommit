# Hospital Management Platform/FullCommit

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a comprehensive hospital management platform, a web-based platform designed to streamline and optimize various administrative and clinical processes within a hospital. This system will address key challenges faced by healthcare providers, such as managing medicine inventories, scheduling staff shifts, tracking patient records, and coordinating medical equipment availability.

The product will serve as a central hub for hospital managers, physicians, and inventory managers by providing the following features:  
Staff Registry to manage the addition and removal of staff members, facilitate communication between colleagues, and enable physicians to refer patients to specialists.  
Patient Registry to maintain detailed patient records, including vaccine shots, blood work tests, appointment history, and physician notes.  
Medicine Registry to track the availability, alternatives, and pricing of medications, including discontinued or expired drugs.  
Medical Equipment Availability tracker to monitor the availability of critical medical equipment, including hospital beds.  
Shifts Manager to efficiently allocate staff shifts and patient assignments.  
Previous/New Workplaces for Staff to provide information on the current and previous workplaces of healthcare professionals for continuity of care.  
Patient Scheduler/Categorizer to prioritize and schedule patients based on their medical needs.  
This integrated platform will ensure that users have access to the necessary information and tools to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

Basically, there are three types:  
Hospital Managers. Needs: Efficiently manage hospital operations, including staff schedules, resource allocation, and patient assignments.  
Physicians. Needs: Access to comprehensive patient records, availability of medicines and medical equipment, and efficient communication with colleagues.  
Inventory Managers. Needs: Manage medical supplies, track inventory levels, and predict future stock needs to ensure the availability of critical medical resources.

Persona 1: James, age 45, Hospital Manager.  
James has been managing the hospital for the past 10 years. He has a background in healthcare administration. He oversees all administrative aspects of the hospital, ensuring smooth operations and efficient use of resources.
He starts his day early, reviewing the hospital's daily operations report and attending morning meetings with department heads. He spends his afternoons addressing staffing issues, managing budgets, and coordinating with suppliers. In the evenings, he often reviews performance metrics and strategizes for upcoming challenges.
James struggles with the fragmentation of hospital management systems, which makes it difficult to maintain a cohesive operation. He finds it challenging to manage staff schedules and ensure that all departments are adequately staffed at all times.

Persona 2: Emily, age 38, Physician.  
Emily is a certified internist working at the Hospital. She has been taking this career for 12 years and specializes in chronic disease management. She is known for her compassionate care and attention to detail.
Emily starts her day with patient rounds, followed by consultations and treatments in her office. She spends a significant portion of her time updating patient records, prescribing medications, and communicating with other healthcare professionals.
She is frustrated with the lack of integration between patient records, medication databases, and scheduling systems. It usually takes her a lot of time to track down information, which is tiring and prone to errors. Emily wants a unified system that provides easy access to patient records, medication availability, and diagnostic test results. She would like to improve patient care by having accurate and up-to-date information at her fingertips.

Persona 3: Sarah, age 32, Inventory Manager.  
Sarah has been working as an inventory manager at the hospital for 5 years. She is responsible for maintaining medical supplies and equipment inventory.
Sarahâ€™s day involves monitoring inventory levels, placing orders, and coordinating with suppliers to ensure timely delivery of medical supplies. She also conducts regular audits to track usage and identify potential shortages.
Sarah finds it challenging to manage inventory needs accurately, leading to occasional stockouts or overstock situations. She struggles with manually tracking orders and inventory levels. She believes it would be better if there's an integrated platform to manage inventory efficiently, reducing waste and ensuring that critical supplies are always available.

> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

* When: July 19, 2024
* Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

During this iteration, our team focused on developing and integrating key features for the Physician Collaboration Platform, including logging appointments and implementing basic search functionality. We also aimed to ensure the integration of all components and conduct comprehensive testing.

#### Decisions that turned out well

* **Focused Feature Development**: By focusing on specific features (log appointments and basic search), we made significant progress. This targeted approach allowed for clear assignment of responsibilities and enabled us to achieve our iteration goals effectively.

* **Integration and Testing Emphasis**: Allocating dedicated time for integration and testing ensured that all features worked seamlessly together. This approach helped us identify and resolve bugs early, resulting in a more stable product.

* **Improved Version Control Practices**: Implementing a strict branching strategy and enhancing the pull request process have significantly improved our version control. This has prevented accidental changes to the master branch, reduced conflicts, and ensured that all changes are reviewed and discussed, leading to better collaboration and code quality.



#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* **Inaccurate Task Time Estimations**: We did not estimate the time required for each task accurately, partly due to a change in the product direction. This miscalculation led to some delays, emphasizing the need for better planning and time management in future iterations.

* **Infrequent Database Refinement Sessions**: Our team did not allocate sufficient time for fulfilling the complete database structure. 


#### Planned changes

* **Incorporate Accurate Task Time Estimations**: Implement a more detailed task estimation process to better allocate time for each task, especially in light of changes in product direction. This will help avoid delays and ensure that deadlines are met more consistently.

* **Regular Database Refinement Sessions**: Schedule regular sessions dedicated to database refinement and review. This can ensure consistent progress and thorough refinement without last-minute rushes, maintaining data integrity and structure.

* **Prioritize Detailed Planning and Communication**: Increase the focus on detailed planning and regular communication to align the team on priorities and progress. This will help in adjusting to new directions and ensuring that all team members are on the same page regarding task assignments and deadlines.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* **Log Appointments**: Implemented the log appointments feature, including functionality to upload multiple documents per appointment and outcome selection.
  - Implemented form for logging new cases/appointments.
  - Enabled upload functionality for multiple documents.
  - Designed and implemented the UI for case/appointment logging.
  - Implemented outcome selection for each appointment.

* **Basic Search**: Developed the basic search feature, including integration with the backend database and display of search results.
  - Developed the search page UI.
  - Implemented the search functionality.
  - Integrated with the backend database.
  - Displayed search results and implemented pagination.

* **Document Visibility for Appointments**: Implemented the feature allowing physicians to see all documents related to a particular appointment.
  - Designed the UI to display documents related to appointments.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* **Thorough Task Estimation**: Ensure tasks are estimated with appropriate buffer times to account for unexpected complexities.

* **Regular Database Maintenance**: Schedule regular sessions to refine and review the database to maintain data integrity and structure.

* **Prioritize Critical Tasks**: Use a prioritization matrix to focus on high-impact, high-urgency tasks first, ensuring critical goals are met on time.

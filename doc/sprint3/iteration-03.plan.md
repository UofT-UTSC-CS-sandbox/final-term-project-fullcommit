#### Artifacts

<!-- List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.

* Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members? -->

1. **To-do Lists**
   - **Purpose**: Track individual and team tasks.
   - **Usage**: Every team member maintains a to-do list that includes tasks assigned to them. These lists are reviewed during standups to ensure progress and address any blockers.
   - **Details**: Tasks are broken down into manageable steps with deadlines and priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

2. **Task Boards**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize tasks and their current status (To-do, In Progress, Done).
   - **Usage**: A shared digital task board (e.g., jira) is used by the team to monitor and update task statuses in real-time.
   - **Details**: Tasks are created and updated to reflect their current status. Each task card contains a description, assignee, due date, and any relevant comments or attachments.

3. **Meeting Notes and Action Items**
   - **Purpose**: Document discussions, decisions, and next steps from meetings.
   - **Usage**: Notes are taken during each meeting to capture key points, decisions made, and action items. These notes are shared with the team and stored for future reference.
   - **Details**: Includes meeting agendas, summaries of discussions, assigned action items with due dates, and any follow-up needed. Action items are tracked until completion.

These artifacts collectively help the team stay organized, prioritize effectively, and ensure clear communication and accountability.





## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks
* Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
* Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

**Goals:**
1. Implement the log appointments feature.
2. Develop the basic search feature.
3. Ensure all components are integrated and functioning correctly.

**Tasks:**
1. **Log Appointments**
   * User Story: As a doctor, I want to log cases/appointments so that I can keep track of patient interactions.
     - Create a form for logging new cases/appointments.
     - Implement functionality to upload documents per appointment (transcriptions, X-rays, other relevant documents).
     - Design the UI for case/appointment logging.
     - Implement outcome selection for each appointment (Diagnosed/Undiagnosed).

2. **Basic Search**
   * User Story: As a physician, I want to be able to search for appointments by disease name, so I may find detailed info regarding specific appointments.
     - Design the search page UI.
     - Implement basic search functionality.
     - Integrate search with the backend database.
     - Display search results in a list format.
     - Implement pagination for search results.

3. **Document Visibility for Appointments**
   * User Story: As a physician, I want to see which documents are related to any particular appointment, so that I can access all relevant info regarding the appointment in one place.
     - Design the UI to display documents related to appointments.

4. **Integration and Testing**
   * Ensure all features are integrated into the main application.
   * Test all functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
   * Fix any bugs or issues found during testing.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
* Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
* Be concise, yet precise. For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

**Our Artifacts:**
1. **Code for Features:**
   * **Log Appointments:**
     - Implement form for logging new cases/appointments.
     - Enable upload functionality for documents.
     - Design and implement the UI for case/appointment logging.
     - Implement outcome selection for each appointment.
   * **Basic Search:**
     - Develop the search page UI.
     - Implement the search functionality.
     - Integrate with the backend database.

   * **Document Visibility for Appointments:**
     - Develop the UI to display related documents for appointments.
   * **Integration:**
     - Ensure all features are integrated into the main application.
     - Setup initial routing so all features are accessible.

2. **Documentation:**
   * Write comprehensive documentation for all features.
   * This includes usage instructions, code explanations, and setup guides.
   * Finalize documentation for submission to ensure clarity and completeness.

3. **Presentations:**
   * Prepare a demo presentation to showcase the log appointments feature and the basic search functionality to our TA.

By producing these artifacts, we ensure that the project is well-documented, functional, and easy to understand.

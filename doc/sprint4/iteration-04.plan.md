#### Artifacts

<!-- List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.

* Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
* We want to understand:
  * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  * How do you prioritize tasks?
  * How do tasks get assigned to team members? -->

1. **To-do Lists**
   - **Purpose**: Track individual and team tasks.
   - **Usage**: Every team member maintains a to-do list that includes tasks assigned to them. These lists are reviewed during standups to ensure progress and address any blockers.
   - **Details**: Tasks are broken down into manageable steps with deadlines and priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

2. **Task Boards**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize tasks and their current status (To-do, In Progress, Done).
   - **Usage**: A shared digital task board (e.g., jira) is used by the team to monitor and update task statuses in real-time.
   - **Details**: Tasks are created and updated to reflect their current status. Each task card contains a description, assignee, due date, and any relevant comments or attachments.

3. **Meeting Notes and Action Items**
   - **Purpose**: Document discussions, decisions, and next steps from meetings.
   - **Usage**: Notes are taken during each meeting to capture key points, decisions made, and action items. These notes are shared with the team and stored for future reference.
   - **Details**: Includes meeting agendas, summaries of discussions, assigned action items with due dates, and any follow-up needed. Action items are tracked until completion.

These artifacts collectively help the team stay organized, prioritize effectively, and ensure clear communication and accountability.





## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks
* Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
* Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

**Goals:**
1. Implement the log in feature
2. Touch up the UI for Navbar and Pages
3. Remove non-existent Navbar items and make the it grow horizontally
4. Ensure all features are dynamic, instead of operating with hardcoded data
5. Implement audio upload, which parses the text/transcription from the audio files 
6. Develop page where uploaded files can be viewed
7. Ensure all components are integrated and functioning correctly.

**Tasks:**
1. **Login Feature**
   * User Story: As a doctor, I want to log into the app using my credentials, so that I can access patient appointments and related documents shared by other physicians
     - The login page should have fields for entering a username and password.
     - Displays feedback for incorrect login attempts.
     - On success, user should be directed to a page on the app
     - Implement outcome selection for each appointment (Diagnosed/Undiagnosed).

2. **Appointment Details Page**
   * User Story: As a doctor, I want to view the details of a specific appointment, including the patientâ€™s name, date of appointment, and a list of related documents, so that I can review the appointment history and access necessary files for diagnosis or consultation.
     - Should display patient information, appointment date, and diagnosis.
     - The page should list all files uploaded with the appointment, each with a clickable link to view the document.
     - Files should be displayed in an organized manner, either in a vertical list or grid.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
* Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
* Be concise, yet precise. For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

**Our Artifacts:**
1. **Code for Features:**
   * **Appointment Details:**
     - Develop a page that displays all documents uploaded for a particular appointment
     - Enable preview functionality for uploaded files
     - Display Appointment information (date, patient, etc)
   * **Search Appointments:**
     - Develop the search page UI.
     - Integrate with the backend database.
     - Integrate with Appointment Details Page
   * **Login Page:**
     - Implement page for logging users into the application
     - Display form for entering username/passowrd 
   * **Document Visibility for Appointments:**
     - Develop the UI to display related documents for appointments.
   * **Integration:**
     - Ensure all features are integrated into the main application.
     - Setup initial routing so all features are accessible.

2. **Documentation:**
   * Write comprehensive documentation for all features.
   * This includes usage instructions, code explanations, and setup guides.
   * Finalize documentation for submission to ensure clarity and completeness.

3. **Presentations:**
   * Prepare a demo presentation to showcase the login feature and Appointment Details page, as well as show off our updated UI.

By producing these artifacts, we ensure that the project is well-documented, functional, and easy to understand.

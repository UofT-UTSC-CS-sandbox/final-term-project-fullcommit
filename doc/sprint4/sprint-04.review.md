> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 04 - Review & Retrospect

* When: August 2nd 2024
* Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

This iteration focused on implementing critical functionalities such as the login feature, UI enhancements, and dynamic data handling. We aimed to ensure all components were well-integrated and functioning smoothly. Hereâ€™s a reflection on the decisions made, their outcomes, and the path forward.


#### Decisions that turned out well

* **Task Breakdown**: Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks helped in better tracking of progress and ensured timely completion of features.

* **Integration and Testing Emphasis**: Allocating dedicated time for integration and testing ensured that all features worked seamlessly together. This approach helped us identify and resolve bugs early, resulting in a more stable product.

* **Frequent Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews helped maintain code quality, facilitated knowledge sharing among team members, and ensured that coding standards were adhered to.



#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* **Unstructured Testing**: The lack of a structured testing plan led to some issues being discovered late in the development process, which affected the stability of the application.

* **Ambiguous Requirements**: Some user stories had ambiguous requirements, leading to misunderstandings and the need for rework.


#### Planned changes

1. **Implement Structured Testing Plan**: Develop and adhere to a structured testing plan to catch issues early and ensure the stability of the application.

2. **Clarify Requirements Early**: Ensure that all user stories and requirements are clearly defined and understood by all team members before starting the development work.

3. **Simplify Tool Usage**: Streamline the number of tools used for project management and communication to reduce confusion and improve efficiency.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. **Implement the Log in Feature**: The login feature was successfully implemented, allowing users to log in with their credentials and access their appointments and related documents.

2. **Touch up the UI for Navbar and Pages**: The UI for the Navbar and pages was improved, providing a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

3. **Remove Non-Existent Navbar Items and Adjust Layout**: Non-existent Navbar items were removed, and the Navbar layout was adjusted to grow horizontally.

4. **Dynamic Features**: All features were made dynamic, removing hardcoded data and ensuring flexibility.

5. **Implement Audio Upload and Transcription**: The audio upload feature was implemented, allowing users to upload audio files and parse text/transcription from them.

6. **Develop Page for Viewing Uploaded Files**: A new page was developed where users can view their uploaded files.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **Emphasis on Testing**: Prioritizing structured testing is crucial to catch issues early and maintain application stability.

2. **Clear Communication**: Ensuring clear and unambiguous communication of requirements will help prevent misunderstandings and rework.

3. **Focus on Core Tools**: Simplifying the toolset used for project management and communication can improve efficiency and reduce confusion.
